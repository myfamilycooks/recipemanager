Scott’s Gumbo Recipe 

Description

This will come out unbelievably hot.  To temper the heat, substitute pablano or jalapeno peppers and cut down on white/red/black pepper mixture 
I often make this with 2-3lbs of shrimp, skipping the scallops and whitefish.   
I also eyeball (and that’s a *VERY* loose term the veggie amounts.  Usually I go for a pile of, each) 
You can add chicken, and non Cajun sausage (in addition to the andouille) as desired in place of seafood if you wish
